# Reserved Tokens

## Potential Wrapped tokens

The following tokens have been issued as Mintable tokens:  
- BTC (with 8 decimals)
- ETH (with 18 decimals)
- USD (with 2 decimals)

They are meant to avoid cybersquatting and be handed over to a serious actor willing to implement and handle in a trust-able way these Nyzo wrapped crypto-currencies.

## Name confusing tokens

- NYTRO was issued as a non mintable, 0 decimals token with 100,000 supply.   
  We'll likely use it later on as a demo use case.
- NYZO was issued as a mintable token, 6 decimals.  
  This is to avoid confusion between Nyzo (the main currency) and NYZO token and will not be used.  
  Ownership will be transferred after cycle vote if a future use case needs it.
  
- nYZO NFT Class was reserved as an infinite supply NFT, to avoid confusion with Nyzo and cybersquatting.  
- nNYZO NFT class was reserved as an infinite supply NFT, to avoid confusion with Nyzo and cybersquatting.

## Test Tokens
  
In addition to these, we issued from the NCFP funds the following test tokens:
- TEST  (no decimals)
- TEST2   (2 decimals, currency like)
- TEST18   (18 decimals, max allowed, ETH like)

They are defined as mintable tokens as well, and will serve as test tokens for anyone willing to experiment with Nyzo tokens.   
A faucet will provide them for free.
